    <p>Hi there! I work remotely as a Senior Technical Support Analyst at Bullhorn, an online browser-based recruiting software (CRM). Daily, I work with my team of Seniors to support Tier 1 analysts as we all offer technical support for the Bullhorn Applicant Track System or <a href="https://www.jobscan.co/applicant-tracking-systems">ATS</a> as well as to Bullhorn's other product lines to Bullhorn's professional clients. In supporting the Bullhorn product, I work daily within the API, reading and formatting HTML, troubleshooting email issues like those with SPF records, handling networking problems and latency, working with Developer Tools in Google Chrome, writing in SQL, and so much more. When I'm not working, I'm reading, writing, knitting, talking on Twitter, magnet-fishing with my wife, playing with my dogs, playing video games, and putting my hands in many other different pots. I'm a Jane of All Trades in that kind of way. Currently, I'm studying to understand more about Web Development (including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQL, and more) to gain more technical knowledge and be better able to assist Bullhorn clients and others as well. I'm also studying to gain my CompTIA Security+ certification having successfully participated in the <a href="https://www.montgomerycollege.edu/workforce-development-continuing-education/information-technology/americas-promise-program/cyber-boot-camp.html">America's Promise Cybersecurity Bootcamp</a>. I aspire to become a full-time Full-Stack Web Developer in the near future, and I hope to one day make a website for you!</p>
